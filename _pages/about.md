My name is Giorgos and I am currently working as a Software Engineer at [Skroutz](https://www.skroutz.gr/) in Athens. Perviously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Network Management & Optimal Design Laboratory](http://www.netmode.ntua.gr/main/) (NETMODE) of the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/el/) (NTUA) where I obtained my PhD in 2021 and my Diploma in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) in 2015. My research interests lie in the areas of ad-hoc networks and autonomous systems, multimedia technologies, social networks, computer networks and services, and recommender systems for enhancing user experience. My latest research focused on the incorporation of behavioral characteristics of users in the decision making process for the allocation of network resources via Prospect Theory.
